# Weather App

## Product Requirements
You are building a responsive web application that helps users track the essential weather data for a given location. The application will contain the following:

* A widget to accept a city name or zip (postal) code information.
* A widget to display the current weather condition that includes:
  * day (e.g. "Monday, March 1st, 2021")
  * weather description (e.g. "Misty")
  * temperature
  * pressure
  * humidity and
  * wind information

* A widget to display the daily weather condition for 10 days that includes:
  * day (e.g. "Monday, March 2nd, 2021")
  * weather description (e.g. "Partly Cloudy")
  * min and max temperature

* A control to switch between imperial (e.g. miles/hour for wind) or metric (e.g. Celsius for temperature) units.
* The application will remember the input provided by the user such as city name/zip, and imperial/metric units until the user changes it.

## Additional instructions
* Add psuedo code or an actual example of a unit test.
* Feel free to extend the product requirements as you see fit.
